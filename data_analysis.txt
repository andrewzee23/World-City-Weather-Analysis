 Data Analysis

	1.	Looking at just the Northern Hemisphere as the city latitude increased the maximum temperature decreased. This is something we expected from natural occurring weather patterns.
	2.	Looking at the Northern and Southern Hemispheres vs Humidity % I was shocked to see that there wasn’t a stronger correlation with the data. In the Northern Hemisphere I excepted to see as the latitude increased the humidity would decrease where as I would expect the opposite for the Southern Hemisphere.
	3.	Overall looking at the data as a whole in the end there doesn’t seem to be any correlation between Latitude and Max. Temperature.
